spark-ec2
=========

This project is a fork of [amplab spark-ce2 branch-1.5](https://github.com/amplab/spark-ec2/tree/branch-1.5).
See original description [here](https://github.com/amplab/spark-ec2/blob/branch-1.5/README.md).

This repository contains the set of scripts used to setup a Spark cluster on EC2 by using [Apache Spark on EC2 Script](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ec2-scripts.html).
This fork works only with yarn (which installs hadoop 2.7.1) and spark version 1.6.0.  

### Goals

* last version of java8
* last version of scala 2.10
* hadoop 2.7.1 + hadoop-aws
* spark 1.6.0

### Plans

* scala 2.11
* spark 1.6.0 (scala-2.11 build)
